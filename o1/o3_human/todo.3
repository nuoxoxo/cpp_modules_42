----------------8<----------[ weapon ]------------------------


make a Weapon class, which has
	- a type string
	- a getType method
		- getType returns a const reference to the type string
	- a setType method


----------------8<----------[ humans ]------------------------


create two classes
	- HumanA
	- HumanB
		- both have a Weapon
		- both a name
		- both an attack() function
			- a printer function
			- NAME attacks with his WEAPON_TYPE
	- HumanA and HumanB have two tiny differences
		- HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor
			- HumanB doesn’t.
		- HumanB may not always have a Weapon
			- HumanA will ALWAYS be armed


--------8<--------[ don't change code block in main* ]------------


Goal :
	- Make it so that 
	following code produces 
		- attacks with "crude spiked club" 
		- THEN "some other type of club", in both test cases


Q & A :
	- In which case is it appropriate to store the Weapon
		- as a pointer? 
		- as a reference? 
		- Why?
