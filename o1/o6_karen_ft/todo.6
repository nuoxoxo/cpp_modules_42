--------8<--------- [ same files, add stuff ] --------------------

- write the program karenFilter that will 
	---> receive as a parameter the log level you want to listen to 
	---> display all the info that is at this level or above it. 
	For example:

		$> ./karenFilter "WARNING"

		[ WARNING ]
		I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free.
		I’ve been coming here for years an you just started working here last month.

		[ ERROR ]
		This is unacceptable, I want to speak to the manager now.

		$> ./karenFilter "I am not sure how tired I am today..."
		[ Probably complaining about insignificant problems ]

There are many ways to filter karen
-
but one of the best ones is to SWITCH her off ;)
