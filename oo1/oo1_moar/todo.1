-	recycle the Zombie class ---> create a horde of zombies

-	TODO

	-	Write a function that takes an integer N. 
	-	When called, it allocates N Zombie objects. 
	-	It must allocate all the N Zombie objects in a single allocation. 
	-	it should initialize each Zombie by giving to each one a name.
	-	it should return the pointer to the 1st Zombie.
	-	* prototype :

	Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );

Submit a main to test that your function zombieHorde works as intended

feel free to do so by calling announce( ) on each one of the Zombies

Do not forget to delete ALL the Zombies on exit / return
