Make a Weapon class
	- which has
		- a type string
		- a getType method that returns a const reference to this string
		- a setType

create two classes
	- HumanA
	- HumanB
		- both have a Weapon
		- both a name
		- both an attack() function that displays:
			- NAME attacks with his WEAPON_TYPE
	- HumanA and HumanB have two tiny differences
		- HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor
			- HumanB doesnâ€™t.
		- HumanB may not always have a Weapon
			- HumanA will ALWAYS be armed
Goal :
	- Make it so that 
	following code produces 
		- attacks with "crude spiked club" 
		- THEN "some other type of club", in both test cases


Q & A :
	- In which case is it appropriate to store the Weapon
		- as a pointer? 
		- as a reference? 
		- Why?
