---------------------------------8<------ [ Conversion of scalar types ] ----------------------------------------

# Allowed functions 

	- Any function to convert 

		- a string to an int, a float or a double. 

# What to do?

	- Write a program 
	- Program takes as parameter a string representation of a cpp ``literal``
	- This literal must belong to one of the following a ``scalar`` types:
		
		- char, int, float or double.
		- Except for char parameters, only the decimal notation will be used.

# char
	## Examples of char literals: ’c’, ’a’, ...

	* To make things simple, non displayable characters shouldn’t be used as inputs. 

	- If a conversion to char is not displayable

		- prints an informative message.

# int / float

	## Examples
		
		- int literals: 0, -42, 42...
		- float literals: 0.0f, -4.2f, 4.2f...

		- You have to handle these pseudo literals as well

			-> 	-inff
			-> 	+inff
			-> 	nanf

# double

	## Examples of double literals: 
		
		- double literals: 0.0, -4.2, 4.2...


		- You have to handle these pseudo literals as well

			->	-inf
			->	+inf 
			->	nan

	- You have to first detect the type of the parameter
	- then, convert it from string to its actual type, 

# convert

	- then, convert it explicitly to the three other data types. 
	- Lastly, display the results as shown below.

	- If a conversion does not make any sense or overflows
		
		- display a message to inform
			the user that the type conversion is impossible. 

	- ``#include`` any header you need in order to
		handle numeric limits and special values.


# model output


./convert 0
char: Non displayable
int: 0
float: 0.0f
double: 0.0
./convert nan
char: impossible
int: impossible
float: nanf
double: nan
./convert 42.0f
char: '*'
int: 42
float: 42.0f
double: 42.0


================================ note ==================>

/* C does not specify whether char is signed / unsigned, which is
	left to implementations to decide.

On implementations where char is unsigned, 250 is within its range.

And because it’s 1 byte which is 8 bits and that means :

	the signed range is

	from	−2^(8−1)
		ie. -2^7
		ie. -128

	to	2^(8−1) − 1
		ie. 127

* note : 0 takes one spot.

If it were unsigned then it would be

	from 	0
	to 	2^(8−1)

	ie. 	0 - 255

it isn’t range per se, but it is the Max Absolute Entry for signed ones. */
